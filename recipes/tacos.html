    <img src="../images/birria-tacos.webp">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Birria is an amazingly sweet, spicy, and savory Mexican stew. 
        It is simmered to tender, fall-apart juicy beef, that melts in your mouth. 
        This saucy goodness is then stuffed into a tortilla and then dipped into the stew and pan-fried until crispy. 
        This results in the most amazing taco you will ever taste!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups reserved sauce from Beef Birria recipe</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li> 
        <li>¼ cup diced carrots</li>
        <li>¼ cup diced celery</li>
        <li>½ cup diced cabbage</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Beef Birria</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons reserved beef fat from Beef Birria recipe, or more as needed</li>
        <li>8 (5 inch) corn tortillas</li>
        <li>2 cups freshly grated Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped white onion, or to taste</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 medium lime, cut into 4 wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir reserved beef birria sauce, chicken broth, carrots, celery, and cabbage together in a saucepan over high heat; bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, occasionally brushing the caramelized bits (side fond) off the side with the hot liquid, until vegetables are nice and tender and consomé has reached desired consistency, about 20 minutes. Reduce heat to low and keep hot while you prepare the tacos.</li>
        <li>Heat some reserved beef fat in a large skillet over medium heat until melted. Add 2 tortillas and toss with a spatula until generously coated in fat. Toast briefly until golden brown, then cover with Monterey Jack cheese and some shredded beef. Drizzle each taco with about 1 tablespoon consomé liquid, then top with white onion and cilantro..</li>
        <li>Fold tacos in half and press gently. Continue to cook, flipping back and forth, until browned and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate and repeat to make remaining tacos, adding more fat if necessary.</li>
        <li>Ladle consomé into a bowl and garnish with remaining white onions and cilantro. Squeeze lime wedges into consomé and serve with tacos.</li>
    </ol>
